# The Future of Productivity

We believe the future of developer productivity lies in the terminal.

## The Renaissance of CLI Tools

In recent years, we've seen a resurgence of high-quality CLI tools. From `ripgrep` to `lazygit`, developers are rediscovering the power and efficiency of the command line.

## Where Monjo Fits In

Monjo Kompass is part of this movement. We are bringing the modern developer experience to database management.

### What's Next?

We have a roadmap full of exciting features:

1. **AI Integration**: Natural language queries.
2. **Plugin System**: Extend Monjo with Lua scripts.
3. **Cloud Sync**: Sync your connections across devices.

Stay tuned!
