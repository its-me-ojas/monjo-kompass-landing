# Introducing Monjo Kompass

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Monjo Kompass**, a revolutionary MongoDB client built for developers who live in the terminal.

## Why Monjo Kompass?

In a world of heavy GUIs and slow Electron apps, we wanted to build something different. Something fast, intuitive, and powerful.

### Key Features

- **Rust-Powered Performance**: Built with Rust for blazing fast speeds.
- **Terminal-First Design**: Navigate your data without leaving your keyboard.
- **Vim Keybindings**: Feel right at home with familiar keybindings.
- **Visualizations**: Beautiful ASCII charts and tables.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply run:

```bash
cargo install monjo-kompass
```

Join us on this journey to redefine database management.
