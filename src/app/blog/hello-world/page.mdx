# Hello World

This is our first blog post using Nextra!

## Why Nextra?

Nextra allows us to write content in MDX, which combines the best of Markdown and React. We can easily embed components inside our content.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>Click me</button>
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
