# Mastering Flow State

Flow state is that magical zone where you are completely immersed in your work. Every distraction fades away, and you are one with your code.

## Context Switching is the Enemy

Every time you switch from your terminal to a GUI tool, you break your flow. You have to reach for the mouse, click around, wait for the app to load... it's a productivity killer.

## The Monjo Way

**Monjo Kompass** keeps you in the terminal. You can query your database, inspect documents, and run aggregations without ever lifting your hands from the keyboard.

> "The best tool is the one you don't notice."

By integrating seamlessly into your terminal workflow, Monjo Kompass helps you maintain your focus and stay in the flow.
